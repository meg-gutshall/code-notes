# Crash Course Computer Science

## The Mechanics of How Computers Work

### Concepts

**Episode 1**

* The abacus

**Episode 2**

* Computers started with relays
* A diode permits a one-way electrode flow
  * They were used in vacuum tubes and marked the shift from mechanical computing to electro-mechanical computing
  * This technology reached its limits by the 1950s
* The transistors birthed a whole new era of computing
  * Consists of a switch that manipulates the semiconductor to stop and start the flow of electricity
* Relays to vacuum tubes to transistors

**Episode 3**

* Binary = 2, ternary = 3 states, quinary = 5 states
* Three operators in boolean algebra: NOT, AND, and OR

**Episode 4**
