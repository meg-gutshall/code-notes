# Navigating the Technical Interview

> _**Sam Saccone**_

## Navigating the Technical Interview

### The Scope of This Talk

Navigate the technical aspects of an interview, specifically for software engineering positions.

Keep in mind, this is only a small part of the interview process, but it's a _stressful_ part!

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### The Who: The Interviewer

* Looking to gather data about how you perform given a set of constraints
* Looking for a subset of signals to be combined with other interviewers' data

#### The Who: The Candidate

* Question answerer
* Responsible for shaping and steering the questions based on your skills

### The Format of Technical Interviews

* Roughly between 30–60 minutes \(average 45 minutes\)
* Ask the interviewer "What format does this interview take?" to better prepare yourself

#### Option 1: Middle of the Road

* 5 minutes to start: 

#### Option 2: Technical Wall

* 5 minutes to start:
* 35 minutes

### The Typical Interview Rubric

* Usually an interview isn't a pass/fail boolean, rather it fits into a rubric
* Not based on the solution, rather based on how you deal with the constrains you're given to deal with

#### Able to communicate their thought process effectively

Successful navigation of this rubric item is likely to include the following:

* Verbalizes

#### Deals with ambiguity

Successful navigation of this rubric item is likely to include the following:

* Explores the bounds of the problem
* Asks clarifying questions about the prompt and solution
* Creates test cases to validate their approach

#### Expresses themselves in code

Successful navigation of this rubric item is likely to include the following:

* Write valid syntax in language of choice

#### Arrives at a working solution

Successful navigation of this rubric item is likely to include some but not all of the following:

* Generates a solution that solves the problem
* Tests their code
* Arrives at the optimal solution

#### Complexity/Performance-aware solution

Successful navigation of this rubric item is likely to include the following:

* Describes the runtime performance characteristics of the solution
* Describes the runtime memory characteristics of the solution

### The Approach

#### Managing Your Time

* The clock is your enemy and your primary constraint
* Establish time barriers/checkpoints

#### The Fungible Problem

* _Your interviewer will give you a vague and under-defined problem on purpose—expect this!_
* The problem is flexible and you have

#### Pseudocode is cheap and effective

* Utilize pseudocode to quickly iterate and work on your solution
* Pseudocode lets you evaluate correctness prior to committing to writing code
* Works as an outstanding mechanism to utilize test cases

#### The interviewer is your partner, not your antagonist

* Asking questions is welcomed and not a sign of weakness
* Getting stuck on remembering some detail does not signal weakness. Ask for help! The interviewer wants to see you progress, not get stuck.

#### Knowledge of APIS is not as critical as you may think

* Embrace stubbing/mocking during the interview
* Exact knowledge of APIs is rarely used as evaluation criteria
  * It is 100% okay to assert that you are not sure about a function and just write how you want it to work and move on.

### In Summary

By understanding the roles and responsibilities, the evaluation criteria, and by defining an approach to tackle the interview, you can go into technical...
